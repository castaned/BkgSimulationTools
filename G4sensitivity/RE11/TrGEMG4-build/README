Code for the simulation of the sensitivity of a RE1/1 chamber to neutrons, photons, charged particles.

The source files are in the TrGEMG4/trunk directory.
The main file is  TrGEMG4.cc, were you can set the physics list (we use FTFP_BERT_HP),
the DetectorConstruction class and the PrimaryGeneratorAction class.
The GasGapSensitiveDetector class basically is used to collect the useful information in the event.
 
Instructions to run: 
Modify the file paths contained in the following files to make them consistent with your environment:
- TrGEMG4-build/build.sh
- TrGEMG4/trunk/src/GE1PrimaryGeneratorAction.cc
- TrGEMG4/trunk/src/GE1GammaPrimaryGeneratorAction.cc
- TrGEMG4/trunk/src/GE1ElePrimaryGeneratorAction.cc
- TrGEMG4/trunk/src/GE1PosPrimaryGeneratorAction.cc

Move in the TrGEMG4-build directory and compile the application by doing
>./build.sh 
>make

To run do
>./TrGEMG4 Neutron.mac

Please note that  Neutron.mac contains the settings for the tracking cuts.
It is important to set the cut for protons to 0 if you deal with neutrons.  

In the output root file (task3.root) you can find two trees.

In the MyRun Tree you can find some information such as:

* the whole energy deposited in the event in each of the gaps.
  For instance, for the drift gap: driftEdep (total energy) and driftEdepI (ionizing energy only). 
 These quantities are in fact arrays with nine components. 
 If you are interested in the whole energy deposition just take the first one (es. driftEdepI[0]) 
 The other ones are the energies deposited within certain time windows. 
* The energy of the primary particle (primaryEne)
* Vectors with informations of the particles entering the gas gaps,
 such as the particle pdg code (gapTrackPart), the particle generation process (gapTrackGenProcess),
  the generation volume (gapTrackVolume) and the energy (gapTrackEnergy)

In the Garfield tree information about all the particles entering the drift gap are listed (pdg code, energy, position, momentum) .

To obtain the sensitivity VS energy plot you have to make a different run for each energy value.
The sensitivity is not directly stored in the root file. 
You have to run on the output tree MyRun, counting the events with at least one charged particle
in the gas gap (i.e. counting the events where the chargeGap variable is set to 1)
over the number of events where the primary particle has actually reached the surface of the chamber
(i.e. counting the events where the neutronSensitivity variable is set to 1).

A simple example of how to read the tree and compute the sensitivity can be found in runSensitivity.C.

The sensitivity VS energy curves can be convoluted with the energy spectra of background particles that are stored in
the flux_*_ge11.txt files (obtained with FOCUS v1.0.0.0) 
The first number in the txt represents the overall statistics in the energy spectra,
and it is useful to compute the statistical error on the spectra. 
Then you have the particle energy (first column) and the associated frequency (second column).
